# Travel Salesman Paath (TSP) 

### Exact algorithm (tsp)
Two algorithms are presented:
* tsp_hashtable: hash table is used to constructr the array in the tsp algorithm
* tsp_bitset: a bitset labeling to construct the array in the tsp algorithm  

In the input files, the first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city. The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance 


### A heuristic algorithm (tsp_heuristic)
Two algorithms are presented:
* tsp_heuristic
* tsp_heuristic_xtrick: an early_stop trick is used to minimize number of calculations to increase the efficiency. 

The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city. The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance
